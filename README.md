## 💡 The Problem

Most SQL tutorials teach syntax. Students can easily memorize how to write an `INNER JOIN` or a `GROUP BY` query. However, when asked *why* a query returns a specific set of rows, or *how* the engine calculates it under the hood, many struggle. 

**VisualDB teaches execution.**

Instead of just returning a static table of results, VisualDB breaks down the SQL execution pipeline step-by-step. It uses animations and interactive execution traces to show exactly how rows are scanned, filtered, grouped, and sorted.

It is built for college students, educators, bootcamp attendees, and self-learners to understand how databases *think*.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

VisualDB is a 100% client-side application. There is no backend server or real database. Everything runs directly in the browser!

- **Framework:** React 19 + Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (v4)
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **AST Parsing:** `node-sql-parser`
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## 👨‍💻 How the Engine Works (For Contributors)

We built VisualDB to be incredibly easy to contribute to. You do not need to be an expert in compilers to build a new SQL visualization!

The architecture is strictly decoupled:
1. **The SQL Engine:** `src/hooks/useExecutionEngine.js` parses the SQL string into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), runs the query step-by-step using `setTimeout`, and manages the state.
2. **The UI Modules:** React components in `src/modules/` simply consume the hook to display the state.

### Want to build a new module? It's this easy:

```jsx
import { useExecutionEngine } from "../../hooks/useExecutionEngine";
import Table from "../../components/Table";

export default function MyNewModule() {
  // 1. Hook into the engine with your query
  const { step, activeTable, tableData, resultSetData, runQuery } = useExecutionEngine(
    "SELECT * FROM students WHERE gpa > 3.5;"
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => runQuery()}>Play Animation</button>
      
      {/* 2. Show the engine's current state based on 'step' */}
      {step === 0 && <p>Parsing AST...</p>}
      {step === 4 && <p>Filtering rows...</p>}
      
      {/* 3. Render the tables automatically */}
      <Table data={tableData} title="Source Table" />
      <Table data={resultSetData} title="Result Set" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🌟 Our Grand Vision

VisualDB is just the beginning. Our ultimate goal is to build an entire ecosystem of tools that make Computer Science visual. 

Read our **[VisualCS Manifesto (VISION.md)](VISION.md)** to see where we are heading next (VisualGit, VisualDocker, VisualDSA, and more). If our mission resonates with you, we'd love for you to join us on this journey!
